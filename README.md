    now for a small summary in the shape of a list for the article 
**"Learn the fundamentals of a good developer mindset in 15 minutes"**
- keep it simple (overengineering, overcomplicating will hurt in the long run).
- UX is just as improtant as functional code.
- clear communication and understanding is always the first step in problem solving.
- problem solving being done with value and priority of problem in mind.
- stop reinventing the wheel and introduce automation to your workspace.
- documentation and commenting are such valuable assets whenever it is time to revisit an old project.

my list didnt come close to giving this wonderful piece the justice it deserves.

Now for a small revisit of today's class and what was discussed, First thing was talking about the differences between CLI and GUI where CLI is command based and GUI is graphics based.

Then we started our first intro into git/github and learnt some basic commands to handle simple tasks within github. a few notable ones would be cd: change directory -- pwd: print working directory -- ls: list contents of directory alongside several others

Ending the lecture with ACP. Add, Commit, Push. these three commands are a very crucial part to any project being worked on in github and im glad i had the pleasure of learning about all that. looking forward for more tomorrow.
